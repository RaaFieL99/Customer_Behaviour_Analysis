Customer Shopping Behavior Analytics Dashboard:
I analyzed 3,900+ retail transactions to understand customer behavior across demographics, product categories, pricing, discounts, and loyalty. The workflow included data cleaning and EDA in Python, feature engineering, loading structured data into PostgreSQL, and performing SQL-based business analysis. I then built an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize revenue trends, subscription impact, spending patterns, product performance, and customer segmentation. The project delivers actionable insights such as high-revenue segments, loyalty and subscription impact, and discount dependency, along with recommendations to improve recurring revenue, optimize discounts, and strengthen retention.

• Python (pandas, numpy) for cleaning and EDA
• Category-wise median imputation for missing ratings
• Feature engineering (age groups, purchase frequency, segments)
• PostgreSQL for structured analytics
• SQL for revenue and customer behavior analysis
• Power BI dashboard for insight storytelling
